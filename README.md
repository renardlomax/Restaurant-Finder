## How to run
 - Clone repo
 - Create a strapi application
 - Create stripe account. Create a public key and a secret key to have access to Stripe. 
 - SecretKey - path: backend/backend/api/order/controllers
 - PublicKey - path: pages/checkout

First, run the development server:

```bash
Frontend-run npm install -> npm run dev
Backend -run npm install -> npm run build -> then npm run develop
# or
